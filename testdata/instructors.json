Aditi was introduced to yoga by her parents at a young age, but it wasn’t until she moved to India after college and experienced twists and turns in her finance, modeling and acting careers, that Aditi realized the yoga mat is where she was always meant to be. Aditi honed her refreshingly modern, yet history-rich teaching style while studying and practicing yoga in India and NYC for more than 10 years. Named one of NYC’s best instructors, she has taught and hosted workshops around the city and has led exciting events like a 2000+ person class in Time Square broadcast on national television.",
